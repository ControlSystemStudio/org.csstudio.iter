<h1>ITER Control System Studio<br/>
	Introduction
</h1>


<h2>What is CS-Studio (CSS) - Control System Studio?</h2>
<p>
Various control-system tools combined into a consistent environment.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Tools for the developer to develop an operator interface or a state machine:
      <img src="images/opi_editor.jpg"/><br><br></li>
<li>
    And tools for the operator to monitor the process:
    <img src="images/opi_runtime.jpg"/><br><br></li>
</ul>

<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
When you start CSS for the very first time, you will see a "Welcome" screen
that includes an "Overview", "What's New", "First Steps" and "Samples". The Overview might have led
you to this help screen.
</p>
<p>
Use the "Restore" button on the window border to make the "Welcome" screen
smaller, or close it by pressing the "X" button next to the	title.
</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/restore.jpg" alt="Restore"/>
<br>
The "restore" button
</div>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/close.jpg" alt="Close"/>
<br>
The "close" button
</div>

<p>
If you later want to return to the "Welcome" screen to read more,
you can access it via the "Help" menu -> subsection "Welcome".
</p>


<h2>Help</h2>
<p>
Use the "Help" menu -> subsection "Help Contents" to open the help pages,
and read the CSS Applications related entries, CSS Changelog or CSS Core content. The current page is under CSS ITER topic.
</p>
<h4>Cheat Sheets...</h4>
<p>
"Help -> Cheat Sheets..." contains step-by-step
instructions for selected tasks. Use the 'triangle'
in the Cheat Sheets view panel to open the drop-down
list of available sheets
</p>
<p>

<div class="image">
<img src="images/cheat.jpg" alt="Cheat"/>
<br>
Cheat Sheet
</div>

</p>


<h2>CS-Studio Graphical User Interface (GUI) concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Editors: typically used to “edit” the data it displays - text editor, operator interface OPI editor, state machine SNL editor, plot editor.
    An Editor saves changes only when you explicitly choose to save.
</li>
<li>
	Views: Is a window-like element that typically provides a “view” on data. 
Is resizable and can be freely arranged within the main window. 
May provide toolbars that can be used to configure the view
    <img src="images/views.jpg"/><br>
<br></li>
<li>
	Perspectives: Arrangement of various views/editors. Certain menu or toolbar entries can be associated to a perspective
    <img src="images/perspectives.jpg"/><br>
<br></li></ul><br>
