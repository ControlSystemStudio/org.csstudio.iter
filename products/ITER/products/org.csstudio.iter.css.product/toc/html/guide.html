<h1>How to use this guide</h1>
The CODAC Core System is the software package that is distributed 
by the ITER Organization for the development of the plant system 
I&C software (Mini-CODAC, PSH and fast controllers). It is based 
on the EPICS open source framework, with ITER specific extensions, 
such as drivers for standardised I/O boards.
<p>
It also includes the 
SDD suite of tools, SDD Editor/Translator and SDD web application, 
for configuring the I&C software and two sample applications: 
plc-sample that illustrates the development of a simple PLC-based 
I&C application and ich-sample that illustrates a complete I&C 
application with simulated process.
<p>
To get started with CODAC Core System, 
you can quickly try ICH Sample, SDD Editor, SDD Browser and 
PLC Sample (requires hardware).
