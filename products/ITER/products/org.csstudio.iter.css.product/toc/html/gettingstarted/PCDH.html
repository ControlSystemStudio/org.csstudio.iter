<h1>PCDH - Plant Control Design Handbook</h1>
THE <a href='javascript:liveAction("org.csstudio.iter.css.product", "org.csstudio.iter.css.product.activehelp.ActiveHelpOpenCodacPdf","pcdh/Plant_Control_Design_Handbook.pdf")'>PCDH</a>
 defines standards, specifications and interfaces applicable to 
 all ITER plant systems Instrumentation and Control (I&C).
<p>
Plant system I&C standards are essential for ITER to:

<p>- Integrate all plant systems I&C into one integrated control system;
<p>- Maintain all plant systems I&C after delivery acceptance;
<p>- Contain cost by economy of scale (spare parts, expertise).

<p>This document is applicable to all ITER Procurement Arrangements which include any I&C.
