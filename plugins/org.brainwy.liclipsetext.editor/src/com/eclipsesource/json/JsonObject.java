/**
 * Represents a JSON object. A JSON object contains a sequence of members, which are pairs of a name
 * and a JSON value (see {@link JsonValue}). Although JSON objects should be used for unordered
 * collections, this class stores members in document order.
 * <p>
 * Members can be added using one of the different <code>add(...)</code> methods. Accepted values
 * are either instances of {@link JsonValue}, or strings, primitive numbers, or boolean values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Members can be accessed by their name using {@link #get(String)}. A list of all names can be
 * obtained from the method {@link #names()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is <strong>not thread-safe</strong>. If multiple threads access a
 * <code>JsonObject</code> instance concurrently, while at least one of these threads modifies the
 * contents of this object, access to the instance must be synchronized externally. Failure to do so
 * may lead to an inconsistent state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is <strong>not supposed to be extended</strong> by clients.
