<p>Provides support for bindings between commands and various user input events
(e.g., keyboard shortcuts).</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package provides the common classes and abstract classes required to
provide binding support.
</p>
<p>
All the real work in this package is carried out by the
<code>BindingManager</code>, and most work with bindings can be carried out
directly with it.  The binding manager manages a collection of bindings, and
decides which bindings are active at any point in time.  By changes the various
properties of the manager, the active bindings will change.  The binding
manager implements a caching scheme that is optimized for an infreqeuntly
changing set of bindings, but frequently changing properties.
</p>
<p>
The binding manager also manages schemes.  A scheme is a grouping of bindings.
To create a scheme, use <code>BindingManager.getScheme(String)</code>.  The
scheme must then be defined before it can be used.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to implement your own type of binding, then you must subclass
<code>Trigger</code> and <code>TriggerSequence</code>.  Then, simply use these
subclasses with the <code>BindingManager</code>.
