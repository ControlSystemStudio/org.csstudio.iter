<p>Provides support for bindings between commands and keys.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This just a key-specific implementation of the generic bindings and trigger
support.  This package provides an abstraction layer between the SWT key events
and key bindings within JFace.
</p>
<p>
<code>KeySequence</code> is a <code>TriggerSequence</code> that has
<code>KeyStroke</code> instances as triggers.  A <code>KeyStroke</code> is
composed of one or more keys held down at the same time.  A key stroke ends
when the keys are released.  A key stroke can contain zero or more modifiers
keys, but it always contains exactly one natural key.  A modifier key is one of
Ctrl, Shift, Alt, or Command.  A natural key is anything else.</p>
<p>
Natural keys are further subdivided into special keys and character keys.
Character keys are keys that have an ASCII representation (e.g., Space, 'A' and
Backspace).  Special keys are ones that do not (e.g., Arrow Up, F11, and
NumLock).
</p>
<p>
<code>SWTKeySupport</code> is a static class that provides the link between SWT
and these internal representations.  It has methods for converting between SWT
key events and the internal representation, and vice versa.  It also provides
access to the native-style key formatting facilities.
