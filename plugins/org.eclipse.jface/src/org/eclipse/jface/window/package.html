Provides a general framework for creating and managing
windows.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
A JFace window is an object that has no visual representation (no widgets)
until it is told to open. All JFace windows, including dialogs, are instances
of the abstract class <tt>Window</tt> or a subclass. This package contains
the base window classes:
<tt>Window</tt> itself, which provides support
for a basic windows; and <tt>ApplicationWindow</tt>, which provides ready-to-use
support for a high-level "main window" with standard menus, tool bar, and
status line. Both of these classes may be subclassed to define additional
types of window as required.
<p>This package also contains <tt>WindowManager</tt>, instance of which
are used for managing a group of windows. Window managers are useful in
applications which create many different windows (dialogs, wizards, etc.)
in addition to a main window. Window managers are not required for simple
applications.
<p>The only global state maintained by classes in this package is a default
image for window title bars (<tt>Window.setDefaultImage</tt>).
