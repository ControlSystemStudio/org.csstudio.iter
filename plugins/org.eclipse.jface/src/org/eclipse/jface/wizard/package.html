Provides a framework for wizards.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
A wizard dialog is a specialized window for walking the end user through
a sequence of steps; each step is presented on a separate page.
<p>At the most abstract level, the protocol is given by 3 interfaces:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>IWizard</tt> - a wizard consisting of several wizard pages</li>

<li>
<tt>IWizardPage</tt> - an individual wizard page</li>

<li>
<tt>IWizardContainer</tt> - the outside world from the point of view of
a wizard</li>
</ul>
A wizard is any object implementing <tt>IWizard</tt>. The abstract base
class <tt>Wizard</tt> is provided as a starting point; it is simpler to
subclass <tt>Wizard</tt> than to implement <tt>IWizard</tt> from scratch.
The main responsibility of a <tt>Wizard</tt> subclass is doing the real
work when the wizard finishes.
<p>Similarly, a wizard page is any object implementing <tt>IWizardPage</tt>.
The abstract base class <tt>WizardPage</tt> is provided as a starting point.
The main responsibility of a <tt>WizardPage</tt> subclass is providing
the SWT controls and the backing logic for a single wizard page.
<p><tt>WizardDialog</tt> is a ready-to-use JFace dialog that is instantiated
with a wizard and acts as the wizard's container. This dialog has a standard
layout: an area at the top containing the wizard's title, description,
and image; the actual wizard page appears in the middle; below it is a
progress indicator; and at the bottom is an area with a message line and
a button bar containing Next, Back, Finish, Cancel, and Help buttons.
<p><tt>WizardSelectionPage</tt>, a special abstract subclass of <tt>WizardPage</tt>,
allows whole other wizards to be connected to a root page.
<p>Note: None of the classes in this package maintain global state.
