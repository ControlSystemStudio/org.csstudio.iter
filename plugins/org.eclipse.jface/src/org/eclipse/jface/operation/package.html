Provides JFace support for long-running operations.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
Long-running operations must be dealt with specially in order to keep the
UI helpful and responsive. Typically this involves temporarily disabling
most controls and displaying a busy cursor and progress indicator; while
the operation is in progress, the only requests that will be accepted will
be ones to cancel the operation.
<p>The <tt>IRunnableWithProgress</tt> interface should be implemented by
any class whose instances are intended to be executed as long-running operations.
These objects can then be run in any runnable context (<tt>IRunnableContext</tt>),
including such standard JFace UI components as application windows (<tt>ApplicationWindow</tt>),
wizard dialogs (<tt>WizardDialog</tt>), and progress monitor dialogs (<tt>ProgressMonitorDialog</tt>).
The utility class <tt>ModalContext</tt> defines the basic mechanism and
UI event loop for modal operations.
